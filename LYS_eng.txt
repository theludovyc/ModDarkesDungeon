Hello @everyone,
I make a new mod LYS to remake the gameplay (not entirely).
Basically, melee attack can be launched from positions 12 and can target 12.
And ranged can be launched everywhere and target anyone.
Of course there are some exceptions, exemple to moving from behind : attack can be lauched from 34 and target 12.
Another thing is target mark, be reinforced. Every enemies with ranged attack, not melee, want to shot the target first, sometimes they don&apos;t. Think twice before target yourself. And more skills can put target mark.
Heal can heal stress too.
Combats are more dynamic : move, shuffle, stun your opponent it&apos;s a basic strategy, remaked heroes skills and ennemies ai for that.
The game won&apos;t be easy, you&apos;ll cry, and I think my lights just discover others shadows.

I recommend you to start a new game and enjoy your new adventure !
